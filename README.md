# Node Society
Welcome to Node Society, a collaborative Houdini community dedicated to making the learning journey smoother for everyone.

Our goal is to bring artists together to share knowledge, tips, and resources that help demystify Houdini’s complexities. Whether you’re just getting started or looking to deepen your understanding, this space is built to support your growth through community-contributed files and examples.

By contributing and learning together, we aim to lower the barrier to entry and create a space where everyone can thrive. We truly believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to bring their imaginations to life and in doing so it will push everyone to improve further. 

## Who Can Contribute

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the community. This project is focused on education and skill development, so contributions should be made with the intent to help others learn Houdini more effectively.

To support that goal:

All submissions must include a metadata file that exactly matches the format generated by the official upload script.
Submissions with custom or incorrectly formatted metadata will not be accepted.

We strongly recommend using the [community upload tool](./Upload%20Tool/) to prepare your contribution.
This tool automatically generates all required metadata and ensures your submission follows the correct structure. While use of the script is not mandatory, it greatly streamlines the process and helps maintain consistency across the repository. If you don't want to use the tool to upload you can still use it to generate your metadata file to ensure it follows the correct structure.

Please include comments or notes inside your .hip files wherever possible.
Clear explanations of node networks, parameters, and workflows significantly increase the educational value of your contribution.


The goal of every submission should be to help others learn Houdini more effectively. Thank you for contributing to the community.

# Upload Tool Information

The Upload Tool is a standalone utility designed to streamline the process of submitting Houdini projects to the Node Society repository. It automatically generates the required metadata, ensures correct folder structure, and creates a pull request to the repository on your behalf.

## Windows SmartScreen Warning

When downloading or running the Upload Tool executable, you may encounter a **Windows SmartScreen** warning that marks the file as potentially unsafe.

This is a common issue for newly created applications that are not yet recognized by Microsoft's reputation-based system.

### How to Proceed:
1. When the warning appears, click **"More info"**.
2. Click **"Keep"** on the prompt.
3. The tool will then download normally.

This does **not** mean the file is harmful—only that it is not yet widely downloaded or verified by Microsoft's systems.

## Transparency and Source Code

For transparency, the **full source code** for the Upload Tool is available inside the [`Upload Tool`](./Upload%20Tool/) folder. You are encouraged to review or run the script directly using Python if you prefer not to use the compiled executable.

If you encounter any issues with the tool or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
