# Node Society
Welcome to Node Society, a collaborative Houdini community dedicated to making the learning journey smoother for everyone.

Our goal is to bring artists together to share knowledge, tips, and resources that help demystify Houdini’s complexities. Whether you’re just getting started or looking to deepen your understanding, this space is built to support your growth through community-contributed files and examples.

By contributing and learning together, we aim to lower the barrier to entry and create a space where everyone can thrive. We truly believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to bring their imaginations to life and in doing so it will push everyone to improve further.

## Who Can Contribute

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the community. This project is focused on education and skill development, so contributions should be made with the intent to help others learn Houdini more effectively.

To support that goal:

All submissions must include a metadata file that exactly matches the format generated by the official upload script.
Submissions with custom or incorrectly formatted metadata will not be accepted.

We strongly recommend using the community upload tool to prepare your contribution.
This tool automatically generates all required metadata and ensures your submission follows the correct structure. While use of the script is not mandatory, it greatly streamlines the process and helps maintain consistency across the repository. If you don't want to use the tool to upload you can still use it to generate your metadata file to ensure it follows the correct structure.

Please include comments or notes inside your .hip files wherever possible.
Clear explanations of node networks, parameters, and workflows significantly increase the educational value of your contribution.


The goal of every submission should be to help others learn Houdini more effectively. Thank you for contributing to the community.

## Usage

This community is not a platform for self-promotion, portfolio exposure, or driving traffic to external sales funnels. Contributions should be made with the intent to educate, inspire, and elevate others.

Please share resources that reflect the spirit of collaboration and growth.
