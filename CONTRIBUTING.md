# Contributing to Node Society

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Node Society community.

This repository is focused on sharing educational Houdini files. Please read the guidelines below before submitting any content.

---

## How to Contribute

### Preferred Method: Use the Upload Tool

We strongly recommend using the official [Upload Tool](./Upload%20Tool/) to submit files. It ensures proper formatting and generates the required metadata automatically.

---

## Requirements for Submission

### All Submissions Must Include:
- A Houdini project or asset (e.g. .hip, .hda, .py)
- A `metadata.json` file in the correct format (automatically created if you use the Upload Tool)
- A clear and concise title and description of the project
- A folder structure that matches the repository's organization
- A preview image of your project named preview.jpg
- The files needed for the project. Cache any required files into the project file

### DO NOT:
- Upload simulation caches. Provide the nodes for them to be cooked by the user instead
- Provide any files that you do not own or do not have the rights to distribute

### You Must:
- Own the rights to any files you submit
- Not upload assets you do not have permission to share
- Not use this repository to promote external services, products, or social media campaigns

---

## Folder Structure

Follow the structure defined by the upload tool. Files should be organized by skill level and category, with each project in its own subfolder.
---

## Author Information

You may optionally include an `author.txt` file containing only links to your website or social profiles (e.g., ArtStation, Patreon, YouTube, Personal Website). Do not include promotional language or requests for support or sales.

---

## Submissions May Be Rejected If:
- The metadata format is incorrect or missing
- The folder structure does not match the expected layout
- The content is incomplete or lacks educational value
- The files do not meet ownership requirements
