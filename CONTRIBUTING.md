# Contributing to Node Society

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Node Society community.

This repository is focused on sharing educational Houdini files. Please review the following guidelines before submitting any content.

---

## How to Contribute

### Preferred Method: Use the Upload Tool

We strongly recommend using the official [Upload Tool](./Upload%20Tool/) to submit your files. The tool:
- Automatically generates the required metadata
- Ensures correct folder structure
- Simplifies the submission process

**Important:** It is best practice to sync your fork with the main repository before submitting. If you encounter an error when using the Upload Tool, try syncing your fork and resubmitting.

---

## Submission Requirements

All submissions must include the following:

- A Houdini project or asset file (`.hip`, `.hda`, `.py`, etc.)
- A `metadata.json` file in the correct format  
  *(automatically created if you use the Upload Tool)*
- A clear and concise title and description
- A `preview.jpg` image that represents your project
- All project files needed to understand or reproduce the result  
  *(Do not include external caches. Provide the nodes to cache them instead.)*
  *(Stash any other required assets into the project file if necessary)*

### Do Not Include:
- Simulation caches or large baked files
- Assets or content you do not own or have permission to distribute

### You Must:
- Own the rights to all submitted content
- Avoid using the repository for external promotion or sales
- Respect the community focus on education and learning

## Category Guidelines

To help users navigate the repository and support learning progression, submissions are grouped by skill level:

### Beginner

Focuses on foundational concepts. Demonstrates how individual Houdini nodes work and what their primary parameters do.

### Intermediate

Shows how multiple nodes work together to build procedural setups. Emphasizes combining tools and basic workflows.

### Advanced

Showcases full procedural systems or tools. Intended for complex problem-solving, optimization, and integrating multiple aspects of Houdini.

> Please consider which category best fits your submission based on complexity and learning value.

## Folder Structure

Follow the structure defined by the Upload Tool. Files should be organized by **skill level** and **category**, with each project in its own subfolder.

---

## Author Information

You may optionally include an `author.txt` file with links to your website or social profiles (e.g., ArtStation, Patreon, YouTube, personal site). Do **not** include promotional text, requests for support, or sales language.

---

## Reasons a Submission May Be Rejected

- Missing or incorrectly formatted metadata
- Incorrect folder structure
- Lack of educational value
- Submission includes unowned or unauthorized content
